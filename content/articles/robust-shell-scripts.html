# Howto: Write robust shell scripts
Shell scripting is powerful.  But because it doesn't check each command for
a 0 exit status, it can be very messy and error prone.  When a command exits unhappily, it's up to you to notice.

Use $?

    someIffyCommand
    rc=$?
    test $rc -ne 0 && echo 'error: details...' 1>&2 && exit $rc
